# SchoenTree - Atonal Datastucture

## Basic Overview
SchoenTree is a randomly generated binary tree used to represent a 16 tone scale. Music is generated by only allowing pitch movements to a child node from a parent. Chords should be built only from the allowing paths. SchoenTree.depth_path(scaleTone) will print the available melodies/chords/traversals for a given note.

## Purpose
The intention was to build a synthesiser off of this concept, but is currently no longer in the works.
